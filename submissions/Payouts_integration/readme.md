Integration Steps (Using javascript and html as an Example): 
Finished product: https://rb.gy/y5awd


Step 1: Obtain API Key
Register on Chimoney and obtain your API key in the developers portal t
Follow this tutorial on how to get the get started with chimoney api and developer portal <link>
For this tutorial we will be using the convert local currency amount to USD endpoint this is the url for that https://api.chimoney.io/v0.2/payouts/mobile-money

Step 2: user interface

We will create a small interface for easier integration with our api key the interface will provide a way for us to pass the two parameters that is the amount and the country code that are required for the endpoint.

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="./apifetch.js"></script>
    <script src="./key.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="title">
        <h2>Get usd amount in Local</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="country">
        sample country codes
        <ul>
            <li>Kenya code : KES</li>
            <li>Nigeria code: NG</li>
            <li>Ghana code: GHN</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="form">
        <label>Country symbol</label> 
        <input type="text" id="symbol"> <br/> <br/> 
        <label>Amount  </label>  
        <input type="text" id="amount"><br/><br/>
    </div>
        <div class="button">
            <button onclick="convert()">Convert</button>
        </div>

        <div id="result"></div>

</body>
</html>


The major parts of this code is this line <button onclick="convert()">Convert</button>
Which on click calls the convert method which is where we have our api function



Step 3: Initialize Chimoney
Let's now dive into the real part we will be using javascript for this and use the fetch in built method
function convert () { //function triggered on click the 
    const countrySymbol = document.getElementById('symbol').value; // this are to passed as parameter to the endpoint and the are keyed in by the user
    const amountInUSD = document.getElementById('amount').value;

const options = { // fetch method takes to params that is the options and url so lets define the options
    method: 'GET', // this is the method used get method retrieves data 
    headers: { // takes in our api key as application json
        accept: 'application-json',
        'X-API-KEY': "f53b14db7658d93aeb2f8589838b87e01d730d82b9c73e9878065452902790b7" //for best practices save your api key in the .env file
    }
};
    const apiUrl = 'https://api.chimoney.io/v0.2/info/usd-amount-in-local?destinationCurrency=USD&amountInUSD=1' //pass the url to the endpoint where data is to bne fetched 
    fetch(apiUrl, options) //as we said earlier fetch takes two params pass them here, you can also use the axios method.it's also safe to test your codes in the sandbox/postman before coding it
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(response => { document.getElementById('result').innerText = `Result: ${JSON.stringify(response)}`; ///we stringify the response we get so that it becomes user friendly then we render it under the result div
})
    .catch(err => console.error(err));//if the response is not of status 200 a descriptive error will be returned 
}













Step 4: Make a conversion
Click on the covert button and the result will be displayed



Step 5: Handle Errors

Implement error handling to manage API responses:
javascript
.catch(err => console.error(err)); //this will make it easier to debug your code
