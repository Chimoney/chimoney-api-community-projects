### **Get Started**
 
 You will need `keys` to interface with our products. To do so, follow these simple steps below:

 - Create a organization on [Chimoney Dashboard](https://dash.chimoney.io).
 - Send [us](mailto:support@chimoney.io) the name of the organization, we will approve it!
- Switch to the organization (top right) and go to dev page, you‚Äôd see your keys. It‚Äôs `live keys`, for now. No test keys yet.
 - We will add $10 for testing. You can always send $1 to yourself to test and redeem it back to the organization. That way, you always have funds.

 _We can't wait to see your contribution!!!_
