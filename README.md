# Chimoney Community Projects

This repository houses projects worked on by the [Chimoney](https://chimoney.io) community.


You will mainly be interfacing with:

- [Developers API](https://chimoney.readme.io) Powerful API that enables moving payouts of non-diminishing value across banks, giftcards, airtime, momo, etc.

### **Get Started**
 
 You will need `keys` to interface with our products. To do so, follow these simple steps below:

- If you haven't already, create your Chimoney Developer account by signing up. If you're an existing member, simply log in.
- Switch to the organization (top right) and go to dev page, you‚Äôd see your keys.
- We will add $10 for testing. You can always send $1 to yourself to test and redeem it back to the organization. That way, you always have funds.
